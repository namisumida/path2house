		<h1 id="title-text">Paths to the House of Representatives</h1>
		<p id="subtitle">The new House has been noted as being more female, representative, and novice in their political careers. This tool examines the different past experiences of House members including their education, prior careers, and previously-held political offices. Some experiences, like attending law school or working in business, are more common than others, like receiving a doctorate or pursuing a career in sports. And some overlap heavily with other experiences: xx tended to go into xx.<br><br>
		Click on each experience to see how much overlap there is with other experiences. You also have the option to compare Democrats and Republicans, as well as those who joined the House in 2019 and those who joined earlier.

      as I felt that I could create an interactive visualization that allows for more exploration and comparison than what is available in the NYT visualization.<br><br>
